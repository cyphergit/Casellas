            As chefs and restaurateurs, we continually gather all the influences and inspirations we live with and are exposed too,
            subsequently turning these into the ever evolving and innovative menus Casellas prides itself on. Flexibility allows us
            to be creative and inspiration drives our innovation, never compromising on quality, the food we cook must be delicious
            and visually appealing first and foremost, because taste, texture and experience have always been our ultimate goal.
